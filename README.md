### **Development Workflow**

1. **Backend**:
    
    - Develop and test the signaling server (`signaling-server/`).
    - Ensure WebSocket communication is reliable.
2. **Frontend**:
    
    - Integrate WebRTC and signaling (`frontend/`).
    - Build a user-friendly UI for inputting magnet links and viewing video.
3. **Torrent Core**:
    
    - Implement piece parsing and communication (`torrent-core/`).
    - Focus on streaming logic for smooth playback.
4. **Integration**:
    
    - Combine signaling, WebRTC, and torrent logic for end-to-end functionality.



Implementing your own version of WebTorrent is a challenging but rewarding task. It involves understanding torrenting protocols (BitTorrent and WebRTC), as well as implementing the necessary peer-to-peer communication and file streaming mechanisms. Here's how you can approach this:

---

### **1. Understand the BitTorrent Protocol**

- **Core Concepts**:
    - **Tracker**: A server that helps peers discover each other.
    - **Peers**: Clients that download and upload pieces of the file.
    - **Pieces**: Files are divided into chunks; peers share these chunks.
    - **Metadata**: Magnet links point to a torrent’s metadata, which includes info about files and pieces.
- **Specification**: Familiarize yourself with the BitTorrent specification.

---

### **2. Understand WebRTC for Browser-based P2P**

- WebRTC enables peer-to-peer communication in the browser.
- **Data Channels**: WebRTC supports data channels for sending/receiving data.
- **Signaling**: You’ll need a signaling server to exchange connection details between peers.

---

### **3. Components to Implement**

#### **A. Torrent Metadata Parsing**

- Parse `.torrent` files or magnet links to retrieve metadata (info hash, tracker URLs, etc.).
- Libraries like `bencode` can help parse torrent metadata.

#### **B. Tracker Communication**

- Implement UDP or HTTP requests to trackers to get the list of peers.
- Use the Tracker Protocol specification.

#### **C. Peer Connections**

- Establish peer-to-peer connections using WebRTC.
- Implement a signaling server (using WebSocket or similar) for initial connection setup.

#### **D. File Piece Management**

- Divide files into pieces and maintain a piece map.
- Implement algorithms for:
    - **Piece Selection**: Choose pieces to request from peers (e.g., rarest-first or sequential for streaming).
    - **Integrity Check**: Verify pieces using SHA-1 hashes.

#### **E. File Streaming**

- Use a Readable Stream API to serve downloaded chunks to a video player.
- Serve the content with proper headers (e.g., `Content-Type` and `Content-Range`).

---

### **4. High-Level Workflow**

1. Parse the magnet link to get the info hash and tracker details.
2. Contact trackers to get a list of peers.
3. Use WebRTC to establish connections with peers.
4. Exchange pieces of the file with peers.
5. Buffer downloaded pieces and stream them to the video player.

---

### **5. Challenges**

- **Streaming vs. Downloading**: Unlike downloading, streaming requires a sequential piece request strategy to avoid playback interruptions.
- **Peer Discovery**: Efficiently managing peer connections and ensuring availability of all pieces.
- **Buffer Management**: Handle incomplete or missing pieces gracefully.
- **Performance**: Optimize data transfers for low latency and smooth playback.

---

### **6. Development Steps**

#### **Phase 1: Basic P2P Network**

- Implement a signaling server to connect peers using WebRTC.
- Exchange simple messages (e.g., "hello world") between peers.

#### **Phase 2: BitTorrent Protocol**

- Parse torrent metadata and request pieces from peers.
- Implement a piece selection algorithm.

#### **Phase 3: Streaming**

- Integrate the P2P backend with a streaming-capable video player.
- Serve chunks as they are downloaded.

#### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**

- Add support for multiple files.
- Display download/upload stats and peer information.
